Community is the ❤️ of open source
Healthy, thriving communities fuel the thousands of hours poured into open source every week. Many contributors point to other people as the reason for working - or not working - on open source. By learning how to tap into that power constructively, you’ll help someone out there have an unforgettable open source experience.
